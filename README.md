# F-Matrix-Computation-Usage-ROS-PKG
This project includes a code to compute F and a ROS Package which does the same.


Simple python code is available in python .py file.
This code uses a stereo image set from skimage, displays left and right image. 
It computes F matrix and uses F Matrix to plot a line l' = Fx for all the x selected in left image using left-click mouse button.
A ROS Package which does the same is also included.

Thanks
